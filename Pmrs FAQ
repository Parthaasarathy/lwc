Lightning Related Questions

1. Any Lightning Upgrade?

Lightning is continuously upgraded by Salesforce with improvements in performance, new components, and enhanced developer tools. Key recent upgrades include advanced Einstein AI integrations, Lightning Web Security for improved security, and enhancements in Dynamic Forms and Actions to provide users more flexibility and customization.



2. What is LDS (Lightning Data Service) and what does it do?

LDS is a data layer in Lightning that allows developers to handle record data without Apex code. It provides a declarative approach for CRUD operations, which enhances efficiency by caching data, thus minimizing server requests and improving performance. LDS ensures data consistency across components, making it ideal for building efficient, interactive Lightning components.



3. Having LDS benefits LWC?

Yes, LDS is highly beneficial for LWC as it enables components to access and manage records declaratively, improving load times, reducing server calls, and simplifying data handling. It also manages record sharing and security automatically, reducing the complexity of coding security from scratch.



4. LMS (Lightning Message Service)

LMS is a framework for cross-component communication in Lightning. It allows Aura and LWC components to communicate seamlessly within a single page or app, even across different DOM hierarchies. LMS improves modularity and flexibility, especially in complex applications where components need to share data or react to each other's changes.



5. What is Lightning Data Service?

Lightning Data Service is a standard service for loading, saving, and creating records in Lightning Experience. Similar to a client-side cache, it minimizes the number of server requests and improves the speed and reliability of data operations. LDS automatically handles security and sharing, making it efficient for managing Salesforce data.



6. Aura and LWC difference?

Aura Components are the older framework in Salesforce's UI layer, offering component-based development, but with more boilerplate code. LWC (Lightning Web Components) is newer and leverages native web standards, resulting in better performance, lighter components, and simpler code. LWC is more modern, aligns with standard JavaScript, and is generally recommended for new development.



7. Performance - who were they fixed during the experience?

Performance improvements in Lightning are achieved through various techniques, such as lazy loading, using LDS for efficient data caching, optimizing component load time, and leveraging the latest LWC framework improvements. Salesforce regularly updates Lightning to reduce client-side rendering issues and optimize backend efficiency.



8. Any difference between OmniScript and LWC in terms of functionality?

OmniScript is part of Salesforce Industries (Vlocity) and is designed for complex, guided workflows. It’s a declarative tool to build customizable, industry-specific flows without coding. LWC, on the other hand, is a web component framework that enables custom front-end development. OmniScript is more suited for industry-specific guided flows, while LWC offers broader flexibility for general web development.



9. What is DOM and Shadow DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree structure representing a web page's elements. Shadow DOM is a part of the Web Components standard, encapsulating a component’s DOM to prevent style and script conflicts. In LWC, Shadow DOM ensures component styles are scoped locally, enhancing modularity and preventing unintended CSS leakage.



10. LWC lifecycle hooks?

LWC has several lifecycle hooks for managing component behavior:

connectedCallback() – Executes when the component is inserted into the DOM.

disconnectedCallback() – Fires when the component is removed from the DOM.

renderedCallback() – Runs after every render of the component.

errorCallback(error, stack) – Captures errors in descendant components.




11. How to communicate and pass information between 2 LWCs?

Communication between two LWCs can be achieved using:

Public properties for parent-to-child communication.

Custom events for child-to-parent communication.

Lightning Message Service (LMS) for sibling or cross-DOM communication.

Pub-Sub model for component communication within a single page.




12. LWC Best Practices?

Follow best practices such as:

Keeping components modular and focused on a single task.

Using LDS to handle data operations efficiently.

Leveraging Shadow DOM for encapsulated styling.

Avoiding complex JavaScript logic in templates.

Using reactive properties and decorators (@api, @track, @wire) wisely for performance and clarity.





Apex and Flows Related Questions

1. Lead - what is the day in / out activities?

Day-to-day activities for managing Leads typically include tracking lead statuses, nurturing and qualifying leads through automated workflows, analyzing lead sources, and ensuring follow-up tasks. Flows and Process Builder can automate routine actions such as assignment, qualification scoring, and notifications, allowing for efficient lead management.




Here are detailed responses to the additional questions in the image to help you excel in your interview:

Technical Salesforce Questions

1. Test Coverage Standards

Salesforce requires at least 75% code coverage for deployment to production, meaning 75% of Apex code must be covered by tests. However, aiming for 90-95% is a best practice to ensure high-quality, reliable code, especially for critical business logic.



2. Any Test Case Failures during Deployments? If yes, how are they handled?

If test cases fail during deployment, I first check the error messages to identify if they’re due to dependency issues, governor limits, or code logic errors. I then debug by using Salesforce’s Developer Console and modify the test data or logic as needed to ensure robust, passing test cases before re-deploying.



3. Trigger Best Practices

Best practices include:

Using only one trigger per object to avoid logic conflicts.

Keeping logic in a handler class and using triggers only for orchestration.

Avoiding recursive calls by using static variables.

Following order of execution and avoiding SOQL/DML operations inside loops to prevent governor limits.




4. What is Apex Action and what do you do with Apex Actions?

Apex actions are methods in Apex classes that can be invoked by Lightning components and flows. They are used to handle complex business logic that requires server-side processing, allowing components to offload heavy operations to the backend.



5. Asynchronous Apex and why are they used?

Asynchronous Apex (like Future Methods, Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, and Scheduled Apex) handles operations that are resource-intensive or need to run independently of the current transaction. They are used for tasks such as processing large datasets, making callouts to external services, and improving system performance by deferring certain operations.



6. What are Apex Job Queues?

Apex Job Queues manage asynchronous operations, allowing Salesforce to queue and execute asynchronous Apex requests like batch and scheduled jobs. They ensure that these jobs are handled systematically, avoiding conflicts and optimizing resource usage.



7. How do you schedule Apex Jobs?

Apex jobs can be scheduled using the System.schedule method, where you specify the job name, a CRON expression for timing, and an instance of the Schedulable class. Alternatively, the Setup UI provides a point-and-click interface to schedule these jobs without coding.



8. How do you set up security for Apex Class?

Security is enforced by declaring Apex classes as with sharing or without sharing to respect or bypass sharing rules. Additionally, field- and object-level security can be enforced using Schema methods or checking permissions programmatically to ensure secure data access.



9. Code - Flow / Process Builder / Trigger, what would you choose and why?

The choice depends on complexity and need:

Flows for complex, declarative automation and interactive screens.

Process Builder for simple, declarative workflows with limited branching.

Triggers for advanced, complex, and conditional automation beyond what Flow and Process Builder can handle, especially if it requires server-side logic.




10. How many flows are recommended for an object in Salesforce?

It’s recommended to have only one record-triggered flow per object per trigger context (create, update, delete) to simplify management and avoid conflicts. However, complex cases may require multiple flows if carefully orchestrated.



11. Triggers - How many triggers can be used for an object?

Only one trigger per object is recommended, though multiple can technically exist. Using one trigger simplifies maintenance and helps avoid recursive loops or logic conflicts.



12. Coding practice to have good high test coverage?

To ensure high test coverage:

Write unit tests covering all paths and edge cases.

Use System.assert statements to verify outcomes.

Avoid relying on hardcoded IDs; use dynamic test data instead.

Write tests for both positive and negative scenarios, and cover all branches.




13. How do you review your code to make it quality code?

Code quality review involves checking for:

Proper use of naming conventions.

Adherence to best practices (e.g., avoiding SOQL in loops).

Code readability, modularization, and reusability.

Performance optimization, especially for bulk processing.

Ensuring secure data access by enforcing sharing rules.




14. Did you work on any limitation errors to avoid governor limits during the experience?

Yes, common strategies include:

Bulkifying code by processing records in collections.

Using asynchronous Apex for long-running processes.

Caching data and avoiding unnecessary SOQL queries in loops.

Utilizing query limits and handling recursive triggers with static variables.




15. If we have multiple criteria in a flow, how do you do it?

Multiple criteria in a flow can be managed using decision elements to branch logic based on conditions. Nested decision elements can handle complex criteria, and formula fields within the flow can be used for advanced logic.



16. There is a code that is causing the processing limits (Governor limit problem), how would these limits be avoided?

To avoid governor limits:

Optimize SOQL queries by using LIMIT and filtering unnecessary data.

Avoid SOQL/DML in loops; batch DML operations instead.

Use collections like maps and sets to manage data in bulk.

Consider asynchronous processing (e.g., Batch Apex, Future Methods) for resource-intensive operations.




17. What are Future Methods?

Future Methods are asynchronous Apex methods marked with @future. They run in the background and are useful for callouts to external systems or offloading tasks that do not need to complete immediately. They help reduce processing time and avoid hitting limits in synchronous transactions.



18. What migration tools have been used during the experience, Any idea on ANT tool?

Salesforce offers several migration tools, including:

Change Sets for straightforward, declarative migrations between connected environments.

Salesforce CLI (sfdx) for scripted deployments.

ANT Migration Tool, which is based on Apache ANT and provides flexibility for deployments, especially in CI/CD pipelines, allowing automated pushes and pulls between orgs.
