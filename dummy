Use Case: General Healthcare + Patient Lifestyle Marketplace Integration
1. Objective:
Build a comprehensive healthcare and lifestyle management platform using Salesforce Health Cloud and OmniStudio to offer integrated solutions for clinical healthcare and lifestyle wellness services.
 
2. Background Problem:
Traditional healthcare focuses primarily on reactive treatments rather than preventive care.
Patients lack an integrated platform that connects clinical healthcare services (appointments, treatments, and EHR) with wellness services (fitness programs, diet plans, mental health counseling).
Service recommendations are often generic and not tailored to individual health conditions or goals.
Providers lack visibility into patients' engagement with lifestyle services, limiting their ability to offer holistic care.
3. Proposed Solution:
A. General Healthcare Module:
Manage Appointments: Patients can book, reschedule, and cancel appointments with healthcare professionals.
EHR Integration: Access to patient medical records, test results, and treatment history.
Care Plans: Personalized care plans tailored to each patient's health conditions.
Telehealth Integration: Enable virtual consultations with healthcare providers.
B. Lifestyle Marketplace Module:
Service Discovery: Patients can browse and book wellness services like yoga classes, nutrition counseling, or gym memberships.
Personalized Recommendations: Service suggestions based on patient health data (e.g., recommending stress management services for anxiety patients).
Booking & Payments: Integration with third-party platforms and payment gateways for seamless transactions.
Feedback Mechanism: Patients can provide ratings and feedback for wellness services.
Provider Dashboard: Healthcare professionals can monitor patient engagement with wellness services and track outcomes.
