Account Management
Goal: Build a Lightning Web Component (LWC) that displays and allows editing of Account records in a table format.
Features to Include:
Display Account Records:
Show a table with Account records, including these fields:
Name
Industry
Annual Revenue
Phone
Inline Editing:
Allow users to edit the Industry and Annual Revenue fields directly in the table.
Save the changes to Salesforce when a user clicks out of the cell after editing.
Show a small indicator (e.g., checkmark or spinner) to confirm the save was successful.
Search Functionality:
Add a search box at the top to let users search by Account Name or Phone.
Filter by Industry:
Include a dropdown at the top to filter the list of accounts by Industry.
The filter should update the table without needing to reload the entire page.
Status Notifications:
Show a message if a change is saved successfully or if there is an error during the save.
Make the messages clear and easy to understand.
